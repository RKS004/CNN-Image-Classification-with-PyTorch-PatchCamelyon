# CNN-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch-PatchCamelyon
This project develops CNNs for image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PatchCamelyon datasets. It evaluates VGG19, ResNet18, and a simple CNN with Adam and SGD optimizers to identify the best model-optimizer combinations. Python and PyTorch are used for training and testing.

Provides instructions on how to use the code, replicate the results, and contribute to the project.
