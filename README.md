# CNN-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch-PatchCamelyon
This project develops CNNs for image classification on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and PatchCamelyon datasets. It evaluates VGG19, ResNet18, and a simple CNN with Adam and SGD optimizers to identify the best model-optimizer combinations. Python and PyTorch are used for training and testing.

Please note that executing the PatchCamelyon dataaset may require more computational resources, such as a high-performance GPU, due to the dataset's size and complexity. Hence for users with limited resources, the PatchCamelyon_smaller_dataset.ipynb notebook offers a feasible alternative for experimentation.

Feel free to explore these notebooks, modify the code, and further improve the models for image classification tasks.

The results for each performance can be seen in each of the notebooks respectively.
